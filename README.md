## About
This is a simple Django CRUD application for managing media files, specifically images. The application enables you to upload, update, and delete images along with their titles.
## It's Just a Test Application
In a real-world scenario, we would typically use dedicated file servers or cloud storage services like AWS S3 or Azure Storage to handle files. However, for demonstration purposes, this application directly stores user-uploaded files alongside the source code.
